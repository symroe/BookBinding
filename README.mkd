# Book Binder #

This is a set of scripts for converting PDFs in to a format suited to manual book binding.

For the moment there is only one format: 8 page double folded.

Place your PDFs in the ./pdfs folder, run format.py and find your books reasy to print in ./books.

Requires python 2.7 and imagemagick.
